            <h2>My Plans After High School</h2>
            <p>I plan to pursue a career in computer science/software engineering. I enrolled in the AP Computer Science
                Principles class at Clovis High in my junior year. Additionally, in my senior year, I also took the Web
                Application Development lab at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART). These experiences
                provided me with a solid foundation and better prepared me for my studies in college.</p>
